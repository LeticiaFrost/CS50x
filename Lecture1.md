# CS50x - Lecture 1 C
In this class we focused in your first programming leanguage (c) and the paradigms of programming

  Source code -> Compiller -> Machine code
  
  Source code: the code I wrote, example, printf("Hello world!!")
  
  Compiller: translate my code into machine code (functions into binary sistem)
  
  Machine code: essentialy binary code

  Terminal (CLI): command-line interface
  
  Some commands that we learned in this class;
    
      code hello.c (create a file)
      make hello (compille source code into machine code)
      ./ hello (execute a file)
      ls (list directories)
      cd (change directory)
      cp (copy)
      rm (remove)
      mv (move/rename)
      .. (get back to parent folder)

  stdio.h (standart header file), c library

  Data structure in c:
  
    strings (%s)
    char(%c)
    int (%d)
    long(%ld)
    float(%f)
    double (%lf).

  And we learned about: 
  
    conditionals (if, else and if)
    operators (math)
    variables and loops (for and while)
