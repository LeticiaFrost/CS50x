Codes and lecture's notes
  Computer Science: Study of information and processing
    -> Problem solving (input) -> (algorithm) -> (output)

  Base-2 (binary), 0 or 1, up or down
    -> Binary digit: bit
    -> Pack of 8 bit its byte

  We also studied how computers understand and transforms letters in 0 and 1 (ASCII and Unicode), how colors are in binary (RGB, 3 bytes, 1 for red, 1 for green and other for blue) and how sounds/songs are transported in binary.

  Algorithm: Step by step instructions for solving some problem
    -> How to do something, very very very precise

  And in this class we dived in scratch to learn basic codes like, print hello world, conditionals, loops.
